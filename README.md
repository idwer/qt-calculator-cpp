A simple calculator written in C++.
-----------------------------------

Requirements
------------
This program was developed using Qt Creator 4.11.0 and Qt 5.12.8.

Install qt5-default, qt5-gmake-bin.
Optionally install Qt Creator.

To generate a Makefile, you need to install and run 'qmake'.

Adding new features using QTCreator
-----------------------------------
You might run into the situation where code completion in Qt Creator won't work. A workaround is disabling the
ClangCodeModel plugin: https://forum.qt.io/topic/107498/code-completion-is-not-working-in-qtcreator/6
